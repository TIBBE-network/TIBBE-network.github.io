# TIBBE BrainWeb

A permanent space for the _The Integrative Biology of Brain Evolution_ network community find collaborators, projects and start working together. 

We aim at sharing data, tools and experiences across scales and taxa. The TIBBE-Web has been created to add a community component that allows to find collaborators and projects across labs.
The TIBBE-Web is part of the larger [BrainWeb](https://brain-web.github.io) and you can explore the larger network beyond brain evolution. 

Come join the TIBBE community at [https://TIBBE-network.github.io](https://TIBBE-network.github.io).

TIBBE is generously funded by a European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) Special Topic Network (STN).
